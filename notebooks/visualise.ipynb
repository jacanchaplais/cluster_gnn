    "Hovering over a node once clicked will display the particle's general properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few limited settings you can fiddle with below. The higher the number\n",
    "of edges you set, the longer it will take to form the graph.\n",
    "The graph also may become quite crowded and hard to see, so there is an option\n",

    "the arrangement in space is just the result of a physics solver trying\n",
    "to arrange the nodes sensibly based on their connections.\n",
    "It treats the edges like springs and evolves the system into equilibrium."
